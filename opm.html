        <h1>One punch man</h1>
            <p>After rigorously training for three years, the ordinary Saitama has gained immense strength which allows him to take out anyone and anything with just one punch. He decides to put his new skill to good use by becoming a hero.</p>
            <p>However, he quickly becomes bored with easily defeating monsters, and wants someone to give him a challenge to bring back the spark of being a hero.</p>
            <p>Upon bearing witness to Saitama's amazing power, Genos, a cyborg, is determined to become Saitama's apprentice.</p>
            <p>During this time, Saitama realizes he is neither getting the recognition that he deserves nor known by the people due to him not being a part of the Hero Association.</p>
            <p>Wanting to boost his reputation, Saitama decides to have Genos register with him, in exchange for taking him in as a pupil. Together, the two begin working their way up toward becoming true heroes, hoping to find strong enemies and earn respect in the process.</p>

            <h1>Saitama</h1>
            <p> Saitama is the most powerful hero alive. Having apparently trained himself to superhuman condition, Saitama faces an existential crisis as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroic deeds.</p>
            <p> He is registered with the Heroes Association as a C-Class Superhero and is tasked to defend Z-City against Mysterious Beings.</p>

            <section class="saitamamoretext">
                <p>Saitama is usually deliberately drawn in a simpler style than other characters, with a very rounded head and only a simple mouth and eyes. When drawn in a more 'action-oriented' style with more detail, Saitama is revealed to have sharp features, dangerous looking eyes, and chiseled musculature. His costume is a plain yellow jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a belt. The costume is finished out by an ensemble of red boots and gloves, and a white cape.</p>
                <p> For a superhero, Saitama is rather laid back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn't take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it's too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and 'unimpressive' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.</p>

            <h1>Genos</h1>
            <p> Genos is a 19-year-old cyborg and disciple of Saitama. He is always aiming to become stronger and fights for justice. As a registered Superhero, he is in the S-Class ranking at 14.</p>
            <p> Genos is an extremely serious character. He has a strong drive to get stronger than he is, and pesters Saitama to train him frequently.</p>
            <p>Genos has a mechanical body of a teenage young man, a pale looking face, blond eyebrows, black sclera and yellow piercing eyes and has blond spiky hair. Over his mechanical limbs, he wears black pants and black shoes.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="genosmoretext">Genos sometimes sports new black mechanical arms, during the time when he sparred with Saitama, and during the time on preparing to stop a giant meteor, he equipped more block-shaped, black mechanical arms along with a small headgear.</p>

            <h1>Fubuki "Hellish Blizzard"</h1>
                <p>Fubuki is the leader of the B-Class superhero group, Blizzard Group and Tatsumaki's younger sister. Her rank is number 1. She is a tall, pretty woman, with shoulder length black hair.</p>
                <p>She wears a long black dress, black boots and several necklaces all under a long fur coat. Her eyes are bright green, much like her older sister's.</p>
                <p>She is shown to be able to levitate and launch items. Fubuki uses "Hell Storm" where she levitates the rocks in the surrounding area and then launches them at high speed toward an opponent.</p>

            <p>He was the best disciple of Bang's dojo, until he went on a rampage against the other students and disabled many of them for life. He was expelled after getting a beating by Bang.</p>
            <p>He eventually becomes the strongest villain, ranked as a Dragon+ level threat (considered around the same strength as Boros). Using his "God-Slayer Fist," he easily defeats Golden Sperm and most of the remaining S-Class heroes.</p>
            <p>In an epic fight with Saitama, the man is ultimately defeated but manages to escape before the heroes are able to get rid of him for good.</p>
